#WebQ

WebQ is a system consisting of two web proxies, that together simulate a virtual
queue of web requests, and shape incoming load to match server capacity.

# Test Setup Installation

`redeploy.sh` script at `bin/` is used to bring up all the components in
different machines.  Before `redeploy.sh` can be successfully run some
configurations have to done on respective machines running the components.

For ease of referral we will use machine names as such:

Component running  | Machine name
------------------ | ---------------
TokenGen           | MTG
TokenCheck         | MTC
CapacityEstimator  | MCE
TestServer         | MTS
`redeploy.sh`      | PRIMARY

1. clone this repo in each of the machines. One machine may run multiple components 
and can also double up as a PRIMARY machine as well.

		for e.g:
        TokenGen and CapacityEstimator and run at one machine and that machine can 
        double up as PRIMARY machine

2. At PRIMARY machine grant password-less root access to all other machines
3. At MTG update proxy.conf with correct TokenCheck ip
4. At MTC update lighttpd.conf with correct server ip. follow instruction in doc/README and make lighttpd
5. At MCE install Matlab and java
6. At MTS install test scripts available at `ServerScripts` which will be access by user.
7. run `redeploy.sh` from PRIMARY machine
